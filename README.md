# Python
This python repository helps you practice the basic syntax of python. 
In the first file called syntax.py, We discuss all you need to know about variables in order to get started with python.
In the second file called data_types.py, we dive deep into all the 14 python built-in data_types and a special mention of numeric datatypes.
Have fun.
